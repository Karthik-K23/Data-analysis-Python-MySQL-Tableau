#### Problem Statement: Predicting absenteeism at the company during work time


MySQL is used to query the required data for analysis and is exported as CSV for futher data processing in python. Then the pre-processed data is used to create logistic regression and get predictions. PyMySQL is used to integrate python and MySQL to create the database that is used in Tableau to do further data analysis and get valuable insights.
